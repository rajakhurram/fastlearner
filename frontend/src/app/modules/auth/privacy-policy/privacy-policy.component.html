            a web page server. It cannot run programs or deliver viruses to your
            computer. It is uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a

            time by telling the web server that you have returned to a specific
            page. For instance, when registering with or personalizing the
            FastLearner site or services, a cookie helps FastLearner recall your
            specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies recording
            your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
            addresses, and more. This eases the use and access of your
            customized features. Note that FastLearner only accepts cookies. By
