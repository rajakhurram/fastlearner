Hi,

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:02.940
I'm Joseph Labreck,

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:07.639
currently an assistant teaching professor with the University of Colorado Boulder.

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.079
I'm also an Adobe education leader,

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.680
community expert and longtime author of books and video

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.270
courses focused on Adobe creative design software and related

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.969
topics.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:27.129
I'm excited to be designing a course for fast learner focused on the generative A I

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:30.590
features integrated within Photoshop and illustrator.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:36.389
Adobe's been integrating Generative A I features into their products since the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.909
introduction of their Firefly Generative A I Services in 2023.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.069
Since that time,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.799
many of the new powerful features being brought to flagship design applications

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560
have been built around and are driven by these A I services.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.209
In my course,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.189
you'll learn how to leverage a number of these features in both Adobe Photoshop and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.180
Adobe illustrator.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.089
As with all things A I industry demand for such skills is at an all time high

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:12.879
though a lot of the learning material around jit of A I isn't as focused on more

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.720
traditional design workflows and software.

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.959
One of the aims of this course is to remedy that.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.059
Thank you.
